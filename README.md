# ShinyWeb_NingyuanXu

This assignment is about modifying an existing shiny web application, Option A - BC Liquor app (https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial/). There will be three modifications to the original web app:

* One new download button to download the whole dataset.
* One additional BCL Logo image on the UI.
* One tabsetPanel separates the plot and table.

The GitHub repository contains all the source code and raw data for this assignment. 

The deployed running URL for this shiny web will be the following link:  
https://willubc.shinyapps.io/ShinyWeb_NingyuanXu/ 

The source of the BC Liquor Price Dataset will be: https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/bc-liquor-store-product-price-list-historical-prices
